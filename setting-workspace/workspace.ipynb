    "In Jupyter Lab, the console is often started automatically, especially when no notebooks are open.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Is It Useful For?\n",
    "The Jupyter Console can be used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Quick Testing & Debugging – Run small pieces of code without creating a new notebook.\n",
    "✅ Interactive Python Shell – Similar to IPython but inside Jupyter.\n",
    "✅ Running Scripts with Jupyter Features – Use matplotlib, numpy, and other libraries interactively.\n",
    "✅ Connecting to a Jupyter Kernel – If you have a Jupyter notebook running, the console can connect to the same kernel to share variables.\n",
    "✅ Working with Other Languages – Supports Python, Octave, R, Julia, and more if the right kernels are installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Open the Console in Jupyter Lab\n",

    "plt.plot(x, y)\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "✅ Good for testing small code snippets before using them in a full notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using the Console for Variable Sharing with Notebooks\n",
    "If you have a notebook open and a Console running in the same kernel, variables can be shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the notebook, define a variable:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",

    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "print(x)  # Output: 42\n",
    "✅ Great for interactive development and debugging.\n",

    "You can run shell commands inside the Jupyter Console using !:\n",
    "\n",
    "bash\n",
    "Copy\n",

    "!ls  # Lists files in the current directory\n",
    "!pwd  # Shows the current working directory\n",
    "✅ Useful for navigating your workspace quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Connecting to an Existing Jupyter Kernel\n",
    "If you have a running notebook but want a Console to interact with the same session, you can connect to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the running kernel:\n",
    "bash\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "jupyter kernelspec list\n",

    "Edit\n",
    "jupyter console --existing\n",
    "✅ Allows running quick tests without modifying your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Notes\n",
    "The Console is lightweight and starts faster than a full notebook.\n",
    "Good for quick tests and debugging before writing full notebooks.\n",
